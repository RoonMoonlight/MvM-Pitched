# Mann vs Machines Pitched Mod
This mod is idea of Halloween MvM Tour, but sadly no one has created halloween mod, and since I have lack of knowledge about editing, here is my first attempt to be close to halloween.

This mod simply lowers the pitch and tempo to fit with dark halloween atmosphere. Using this mod with [Merasmus Announcer Pack](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/24996) is highly recommended for more creepier/wacky experience.

The MvM music originally created by [Valve Studio Orchestra](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en).
